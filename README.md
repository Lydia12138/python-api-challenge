# Weather Analysis

This project contains 2 Jupyter Source Files WeatherPy.ipynb and VacationPy.ipynb which request relevant data from 2 API providers OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify for over 500 cities within the desired coordinates, and a repo output_data which contains the output images generated from WeatherPy.ipynb.


 Part 1: WeatherPy In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. You'll use the citipy Python library Links to an external site., the OpenWeatherMap API Links to an external site., and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities.

Part 2: VacationPy In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
